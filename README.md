### Journal Entry
Starting out, I learned about the {{ }} syntax to display text in the HTML from the javascript file.

In the 4th lesson, I learned about the v-if, v-else-if, v-show directive and it created a way to reference items in the javascript and causing changes in what can be displayed based off of the values that are being referenced.

During the 5th lesson, the v-for directive made sense to me but I was slightly confused on how to name the first variable. For example v-for="detail in details". I was not able to figure out where the detail variable was but then he explained that the detail is an alias for the elements in the array. 

Lesson 8 had the computed properties and for the most part it made sense to me but I struggled with understanding how this.example works. This is standard in JavaScript but I will need to do some more research on how to use this.

Lesson 9 was exciting because creating components helped so that you could have many different items on a page without creating a massive file filled with the same items. These items are also able to be changed individually.

The 11th lesson lost me with the amount of information that was in the lesson. It makes sense but I will have to look through it and watch the lesson another time to really take in the information. 

Overall, in the tutorial, I learned a lot about how Vue is able to be used.
